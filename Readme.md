# 🎉 WhatsApp Web.js Automation & Sneaker Scraper 🥾

Welcome to the **WhatsApp Web.js Automation & Sneaker Scraper** project! 🚀 This playful yet powerful repository combines WhatsApp automation with a sneaker scraper (under progress 🚧). The scraper is for **educational purposes only**, and we've got some cool features to explore in `script.js`. Dive in and have fun! 🌈
